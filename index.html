      <h1><u>Travel Blog</u></h1>
        <h2><u>Costa Rica:</u></h2>
          <h3>7/7/24 - </h3>
            <p><u>Volc&aacute;n Po&aacute;s:</u> While there was very little information given about the volcano, and there was so much fog in the crater that we couldn’t see anything, the scenery was very beautiful and there was fascinating flora.</p>
            <p><u>Wild Cinchona Hike & Waterfall Trails:</u> Beautiful falls - I have never gotten that close to a waterfall and felt that much raw power. Absolutely the most grueling thing in recent memory to get back up out of the valley though.</p>
            <p><u>Hacienda Alsacia Starbucks Coffee Farm Tour:</u> Learning how coffee plants work, and how they are researched, farmed, and developed was very interesting and informative, but I am not a big coffee guy so the coffee tasting was certainly not my  favorite despite their gorgeous views. I was also very amused by people talking about the different smell able notes of coffee when all I smell is coffee.</p>
          <h3>7/8/24 - </h3>
            <p><u>El Santuario Canopy Adventure Tour:</u> Although the harness was not the most comfortable I have ever worn zip lining, the experience was altogether delightful. The tractor ride to the zip lines was exciting, and although we did not get to see any monkeys, the trees and insects along the long ziplines were cool to check out. One of the guides even taught us about the leaf cutter ants we saw climbing the trees. Some of the ziplines got going really fast and on one of them I went upside down, both of which were quite fun.</p>
          <h3>7/9/24 - </h3>
            <p><u>Nuyaca Waterfall Nature Park:</u> I cannot say I have ever gotten this close to a waterfall that strong. After a short hike we were able to swim under the waterfalls and even go under them on the rocks. The truck ride back was a little sketchy, but we made it out fine.</p>
          <h3>7/10/24 - </h3>
            <p><u>Sierpe Outfitters Mangrove Tour:</u> I was not quite sure what to expect at first from this tour, but our guides did an excellent job trying to get angles for us to see animals, as well as educating us about them. Our guide at one point told us we were going through the monkey zone, and I got really disappointed because at first we did not see any monkeys. In the end, though, we saw three different kinds of monkeys, and the capuchins even came onto our boat. We also saw a sloth but only curled up and in the distance.</p>
          <h3>7/11/24 - </h3>
            <p><u>Pacheco Tours Corcovado to Sirena Station:</u> I will never cease to be amazed at how local people are so used to wildlife I have only seen in a zoo. The amount of monkeys we got to see in the Corcovado National Park was unbelievable. We also got to see a tapir, some aguttis, and an anteater. We also saw a lot of Curaçao, and heard many other birds.</p>
          <h3>7/12/24 - </h3>
            <p><u>Yemanya Excursions Ca&#241;o Island Snorkeling:</u> Although the coral reefs around the pacific coast of Costa Rica are not exactly vibrant, the sheer quantity of wildlife we got to see under the water was magnificent. We saw turtles, rays, eels, and lobsters, but my favorite thing to see was a giant school of fish that fully enveloped us in pretty shining colors.</p>
            <p><u>Tracie the Bug Lady:</u> Both Tracie and Gianfranco, our guides, were at the same time very knowledgeable, and very eccentric. We learned a lot about different spiders and nocturnal mammals, and also got to see by far the biggest frog I have ever seen or heard of.</p>
          <h3>7/13/24 - </h3>
            <p><u>Rainmaker:</u> This little excursion was a hike on the shorter end of what we have done so far. The trail included a lot of stairs, but also some fun hanging bridges and nice viewpoints. The trail took us to several different waterfalls with pools at the bottom where we could swim.</p>
          <h3>7/14/24 - </h3>
            <p><u>Manuel Antonio:</u> This was similar to our day trip at Corcovado, except it was much more crowded and the trails were much nicer. We saw a lot of monkeys, and even saw some capuchins attacking a lady. Unfortunately, the more popular nature of this park has led to people feeding the animals, and they show way less fear of humans than they should and can sometimes be aggressive. We also finally got to see a sloth. There were also very nice beaches although we did not spend much time at them.</p>
          <h3>7/15/24 - </h3>
            <p><u>El Tigre Cloud Forest:</u> This country has a lot of waterfalls, and I think we have seen all of them. The waterfalls were still very pretty, and it was a great experience. The hike was fun, and we got to ride horses back up the hill before being provided lunch.</p>
            <p><u>Finca Modelo Canyoning Tour:</u> This was my first time repelling, and from what I have heard, the waterfalls falling on our heads did not make learning easier. I was starting to get pretty good at it by the end, however. It was fun, felt adventurous, and I would definitely do something similar again.</p>
            <p><u>Finca Modelo Night Tree Climb and Tour:</u> This was a very unique experience. It began with a climb up the inside of a large Strangler Fig tree to a overlook platform. While the climb was fun, the platform at the top felt very fragile and swayed quite a lot in the wind, which was not my favorite and made me feel a little ill. Afterwards we watched the beautiful sunset and went on a nighttime search for animals during which we saw toucans and tarantulas.</p>
          <h3>7/16/24 - </h3>
            <p><u>Curi Cancha Bird Watching:</u> Esteban was very knowledgeable about the birds we saw, or, in my case, frequently did not see. The one bird we were really after was the elusive Quetzal, and we were lucky enough to see it within the first 45 minutes of our three hour tour. In fact, we saw not one but three of the magnificent avian, and they sat still enough for many pictures and a lot of viewing. The rest of the private park was very pretty, and also filled with other interesting flying creatures.</p>
          <h3>7/17/24 - </h3>
            <p><u>Volc&aacute;n Tenorio National Park:</u> The geothermal water features at this park were absolutely gorgeous. We hiked to the point where different streams met up and they were all different colors that blended into one due to the sediments. I could have really enjoyed this outing but I unfortunately slipped and bruised up my right shin pretty badly.</p>
          <h3>7/18/24 - </h3>
            <p><u>Finca Amistad Chocolate Tour:</u> I am a huge fan of chocolate, but I honestly cannot say I have ever seen how it is made, except maybe on TV. The process is very interesting, and being able to take part in it and create our own chocolate was very unique, and also very delicious.</p>
          <h3>7/16-18/24 - </h3>
            <p><u>La Carolina Lodge:</u> I, as a sheltered and introverted child, never went to a summer camp in the stereotypical style. I went to STEM camps and a LEGO camp, but never one with a cabin or a communal eatery. That being said, this is exactly what I imagine summer camp would be. We ate meals at a communal, family style restaurant, we enjoyed the fire heated hot tub, and suffered the horrors of an inadequately sealed cabin: no AC and mosquito nets over beds. All in all I enjoyed my experience. The mosquito nets I kind of liked, and the no AC was tolerable (albeit I cannot wait until I get back to my room with proper AC).</p>
          <h3>7/19/24 - </h3>
            <p><u>Sky Adventures:</u> Some of the ziplines here were both unbelievably high and unbelievably fast. They also had a somewhat lackluster braking system, which led to some hard landings. It was very fun and very exciting, though. The hanging bridges were also very high, and our hiking guide was very knowledgeable. We saw a lot of cool animals, including an eyelash viper.</p>
            <p><u>Papa's Place Night Tour:</u> While it was raining rather hard during our tour, that did not discourage us from trekking through the woods in the darkness for two hours. I am glad we went through with it, because we got to fill in a big hole in our list of Costa Rican animals we have seen: frogs, more specifically the red-eyed tree frog. We were also lucky enough to see many other incredible frogs including the glass frog.</p>
          <h3>7/20/24 - </h3>
            <p><u>Casa Marabella Tortuguero Night Tour:</u> We got to see the only non-venemous snake we have seen in Costa Rica on this tour, but it was otherwise uneventful. We mostly just walked a lot and saw very little.</p>
          <h3>7/21/24 - </h3>
            <p><u>Casa Marabella Tortuguero Boat Tour:</u> I cannot say that I fully enjoyed this experience because at least half the time I was asleep because it was too early. We did get to see a spectacled cayman up close, and some people (not me) saw a turtle. The guide was very passionate about what he showed us and tried very hard to show us a jaguar, although we did not end up finding one.</p>
            <p><u>Casa Marabella Tortuguero Walking Tour:</u> Although this tour was unbelievably uncomfortable, due to the humidity and heat, we finally got to see the smiling face of a three toed sloth, with made it worth it in my opinion. We also got to see many toucans and other birds, as well as a poison dart frog and the remains of a turtle eaten by a jaguar.</p>
            <p><u>Casa Marabella Turtle Night Walk:</u>This was a really cool experience, but not one I am sure I would ever partake in again. We got to see a nesting turtle up close on the beach at night laying eggs, which was fascinating but also a little gross. The guide was allowed to touch the turtle while it layed the eggs to get us a better view because turtles go into a comatose state while laying eggs to prevent feeling unbearable pain. I fell asleep on a log as we waited for the turtle to finish, but we also eventually got to see the turtle camouflage its nest and crawl back into the ocean.</p>
          <h3>7/22/24 - </h3>
            <p><u>Finca Tres Equis Horse Ride:</u> I am not a huge fan of horses, but at least my horse on this ride, whose name I unfortunately did not get to know, was incredibly well behaved and did a great job making this an enjoyable experience. The Costa Rican countryside at Finca Tres Equis is beautiful, but also, as the name suggests, wild. I cannot say I have ever gone through mud as deep or down hills as steep on a horse as I did on this ride.</p>
          <h3>7/23/24 - </h3>
            <p><u>Pacuare River Lodge White Water Rafting:</u> Every time I go white water rafting I remember how much I love the activity. It is altogether fun, exciting, and a good exercise. For this rafting adventure I got to sit in the front, meaning I was the one who was setting the rowing cadence, which was really cool. My arms and back have not been as sore as they were after the rafting for quite some time. The river was also incredibly beautiful, with lots of waterfalls, and clouds crashing into green mountains filled with the most incredible trees imaginable. I would absolutely recommend this to anyone, and would do it again in a heartbeat. This was a great way to end our trip.</p>
